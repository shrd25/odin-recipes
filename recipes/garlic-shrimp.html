        <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
        <p>This simple Garlic Shrimp recipe, inspired by the flavors of Spain takes just minutes to make and it's so flavorful, a weeknight dinner win!</p>
        <p>This recipe is inspired by one of my favorite dishes from Spain, <em>Gambas al Ajillo</em> or Spanish garlic shrimp. It's typically swimming in olive oil, so I lightened up a bit but it's still just as delicious!! It is bright, garlicky, and perfect with some crusty bread or served over rice! And the best part, it comes together in just 30 minutes.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
            <li>Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 piece of butter, and 1/2 of the parsley; cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in remaining 3 pieces butter. Cook and stir until butter has melted, sauce is thick, and shrimp are pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if too thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste; serve shrimp topped with the pan sauce and remaining parsley.</li>
        </ol>
